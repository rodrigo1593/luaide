# luaide 

attempt to make an environment i little easier to make games for ps2 using enceladus.

----------------------fixes--since---03-sep-2023---------private----------------------

* attempt to make an object moving failed in negative directions. solution: just swap the value and the object array name XD.
* while creating a room the objects array type are not being defined correctly. solution: similar variable to "onetime". to allow it to do it once everytime a new object is found in .room files


----------------------------------TODO------------------------------------------------
* sprite specific menu is bugged somehow idk the reason rn but it displays the wrong image/the first image created.
